This is the readme file of The Zeitgeist Movement Website project.


Installation Requirements:
*PHP
*MySQL DataBase

How to Install:
The site/ folder includes all the files you need, this should be extracted
to the main development folder, so if you have localhost/zeitgeist/ it should be this path and not extracted to localhost/zeitgeist/site/
(although you can extract it however you want).

the only thing you need to do is to change the sites/default/default.settings.php
file to settings.php, and set the username password and database name according
to what you have configured

the Database itself is in the db/ folder
(this is in because some modules require adding tables/data..)

When committing to the DB please pay attention not to make unnecessary
changes like adding to the users table, or cache table.. use common sense please :)
The DB is just a simple export from phpMyAdmin to a .zip file, no biggy.

btw, this is just the first way I thought of putting the project 
into a git repo, if anyone has a better suggestion I'm more than ready
to listen!


Good luck.
