This is the readme file of The Zeitgeist Movement Website project.


Installation Requirements:
*PHP
*MySQL DataBase

How to Install:
the only thing you need to do is to change the sites/default/default.settings.php
file to settings.php, and set the username password and database name according
to what you have configured

Drupal admin user
User: admin
password: admin


the Database itself is in the db/ folder
In order to import it you would have to enable the Backup and Migrate module
from the Administration Panel, afterwards go to
Configuration > Backup and Migrate > Restore and choose the
file inside the db/ folder

It is a dump of the Backup & Migrate module.
If you have some changes you want to commit, just dump
with the Backup & Migrate.
Rename the file db.mysql and replace the original db.mysql file.
If you know how to check file Differences, try to change as little
as possible on the db.mysql file (for compatability reasons)


btw, this is just the first way I thought of putting the project 
into a git repo, if anyone has a better suggestion I'm more than ready
to listen!


Good luck.
