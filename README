This is the readme file of The Zeitgeist Movement Website project.


Installation Requirements:
*PHP
*MySQL DataBase

How to Install:
the only thing you need to do is to change the sites/default/default.settings.php
file to settings.php, and set the username password and database name according
to what you have configured

Drupal admin user
User: admin
password: admin


the Database itself is in the db/ folder
(this is in because some modules require adding tables/data..)

It is a dump of the Backup & Migrate module.
If you have some changes you want to commit, just dump
with the Backup & Migrate.


btw, this is just the first way I thought of putting the project 
into a git repo, if anyone has a better suggestion I'm more than ready
to listen!


Good luck.
